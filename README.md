# MinnowBoard-MAX-Relay-Lure
Relay Lure for the MinnowBoard MAX (Low Speed Expansion Connector) 

Plan is to have a Lure with 4 or 8 relays depending on how much of them can be fitted on the design. 
Relays will support 110V and a good Ampere handling.
It will have block terminals to connect whatever wants to be switched; normally open and normally closed connections will be exposed.
It will connect to the Low Speed Expansion Connector. 


Relay options:
Omron G5LE-14 DC3
    Rated curent(coil): 136.4 mA 
    Rated load: 10 A at 120 VAC; 8 A at 30 VDC
                10A at 240VAC (12 and 24 VDC coil)
    Max. swithcing power: 140 W
    
Omron G5LE-14 DC5
    Rated curent(coil): 79.4 mA 
    Rated load: 10 A at 120 VAC; 8 A at 30 VDC
                10A at 240VAC (12 and 24 VDC coil)
    Max. swithcing power: 140 W

Optocoupler: Looking for a good option that can handle the relay coil current in its Collector-Emitter
