# MinnowBoard-MAX-Relay-Lure
Relay Lure for the MinnowBoard MAX (Low Speed Expansion Connector) 

Plan is to have a Lure with 4 or 8 relays depending on how much of them can be fitted on the design. 
Relays will support 110V and a good Ampere handling.
It will have block terminals to connect whatever wants to be switched; normally open and normally closed connections will be exposed.
It will connect to the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
